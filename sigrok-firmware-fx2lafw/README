The sigrok project aims at creating a portable, cross-platform,
Free/Libre/Open-Source signal analysis software suite that supports various
device types (such as logic analyzers, oscilloscopes, multimeters, and more).

sigrok-firmware-fx2lafw is a Free/Libre/Open-source firmware for logic
analyzers based on the Cypress EZ-USB FX2(LP) chip, as well as the
Hantek 6022BE and Sainsmart DDS120 USB oscilloscopes.


Status
------

sigrok-firmware-fx2lafw is in a usable state and has had official
tarball releases.


Requirements
------------

 - git
 - make
 - autoconf >= 2.63
 - automake >= 1.11
 - sdcc (>= 3.4.0)


Building and installing
-----------------------

In order to get the sigrok-firmware-fx2lafw source code and build it, run:

 $ git clone git://sigrok.org/sigrok-firmware-fx2lafw
 $ cd sigrok-firmware-fx2lafw
 $ ./autogen.sh
 $ ./configure
 $ make

For installing sigrok-firmware-fx2lafw:

 $ make install

The generated *.fw files are installed into /usr/local/share/sigrok-firmware.

You can override the install location like this:

 $ ./configure --prefix=/usr

See INSTALL or the following wiki page for more (OS-specific) instructions:

Pre-built firmware files
------------------------

There are also pre-built firmware files that can be used without having
to build them from source. You can download those from:

  http://sigrok.org/download/binary/sigrok-firmware-fx2lafw/


fx2lib
------

The fx2lafw code uses a (slightly modified) "fx2lib" helper library.

It was imported into fx2lafw from

  git://github.com/ubixum/fx2lib.git

as of Feb 12, 2012 (git hash "416c104cbd").

The following files/directories were removed, as they're not needed
for our purposes: CHANGELOG, COPYING*, docs/, examples/, fw/, and utils/.


Hantek 6022BE firmware
----------------------

The Hantek 6022BE firmware was originally created by Jochen Hoenicke in
05/2015 for the Hantek6022API github project by Robert Cope. Full credit
for the implementation of the firmware goes to Jochen Hoenicke, thanks!

Github project:

  https://github.com/rpcope1/Hantek6022API

We've incorporated the Hantek 6022BE firmware into the sigrok-firmware-fx2lafw
repo/tarball for convenience of sigrok users. E.g. so that they can
easily get it with the other fx2lafw firmware files from distro
packages, the build scripts in sigrok-util automatically build/install
it, the sigrok Windows installers automatically ship it, the sigrok
Android APKs automatically ship it, etc. etc.

The files we've integrated into fx2lafw from Hantek6022API were taken from
the PyHT6022/HantekFirmware/custom directory of that repo, using the state
as of 03/2016 (the files were last modified in 05/2015, though).

The git hash of the last relevant commit there was:

  0498e2ab239aabb1084c19e1e24faf56764b217e

Files integrated into fx2lafw:

 - hw/hantek-6022be/dscr.a51: Copied unmodified.

 - hantek_6022be.c: This file was originally created by appending the
   contents of the original device.c and fw.c together.


Sainsmart DDS120 firmware
-------------------------

The Sainsmart DDS120 firmware is heavily based upon the original Hantek 6022BE
firmware, so the items mentioned above apply here as well.
