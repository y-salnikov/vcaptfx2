0.1.7 (2019-11-14)
------------------

 * Add firmware for the YiXingDianZi MDSO (VID/PID: 1D50:608E).
 * Sainsmart DDS120: Fix the 1kHz reference signal.
 * Hantek 6022BL: Fix the voltage range selection (bug #1360).
 * Allow LA captures at 48MHz samplerate (as long as bus conditions permit).
 * Updated build requirement: sdcc >= 3.4.0 (bug #1326).
 * Fix a build issue with sdcc >= 3.9.0 (bug #1404).
 * Bump the firmware version (major.minor) to 1.4. This version is
   backwards-compatible and doesn't require host-side (libsigrok) changes.

0.1.6 (2018-01-26)
------------------

 * Fix an issue with FX2 based logic analyzers that could cause non-working
   and/or prematurely aborted acquisitions (bug #655).
 * FX2 based logic analyzers will now toggle pin PA1 during acquisition,
   and keep it high while idle. On fx2grok-tiny and fx2grok-flat devices
   there's a LED connected to PA1. Thus, those devices will visually indicate
   whether a firmware has been uploaded (LED will light up and stay like that
   while the device is idle). During any acquisition the LED will blink.
 * Refactor the oscilloscope code to avoid duplication (bug #984).
 * Fix a 'make distclean' error.
 * Fix a compiler warning with recent sdcc versions (e.g. v3.6.9).

0.1.5 (2017-06-12)
------------------

 * Add FX2 firmware for the Hantek 6022BL USB scope/LA.
 * HACKING: Update URL to Linux kernel coding style.
 * Remove FSF postal address from boiler plate license text.

0.1.4 (2016-10-31)
------------------

 * Add FX2 firmware for the Hantek 6022BE and SainSmart DDS120 USB scopes.
   These firmware files use the official sigrok USB VID/PID of 1D50:608E.
   The USB VID/PID pairs are allocated for fx2lafw via the OpenMoko project:
   http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/USB_Product_IDs
 * Add analog channel support for the USBee AX (and potentially other devices).
   Only one analog channel is supported. Switching channels (in case there
   are multiple analog channels) is not yet implemented.
 * Add support for the USBee ZX (bug #764).
 * Use per-device USB product string descriptors.
 * Bump the firmware version (major.minor) to 1.2. This version is
   backwards-compatible and doesn't require host-side (libsigrok) changes.
 * README: Update prebuilt firmware download location, other cleanups.
 * HACKING: Prefer git pull requests over mailing list patches.

0.1.3 (2015-11-26)
------------------

 * README: Drop references to obsolete sigrok-commits mailing list.
 * Build system:
     - Use non-recursive Make setup.
     - Simplify and/or improve various parts of the build system.
     - configure: Check the sdcc version (bug #696).
 * Add firmware files for FX2 devices with official sigrok VID/PID:
     - 1D50:608C: fx2lafw-sigrok-fx2-8ch.fw
     - 1D50:608D: fx2lafw-sigrok-fx2-16ch.fw
   The USB VID/PID pairs are allocated for fx2lafw via the OpenMoko project:
   http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/USB_Product_IDs

0.1.2 (2014-05-06)
------------------

 * Fix an issue which lead to the data pins not being tri-stated after an
   aquisition (when the GPIF is idle) but rather being driven.
 * Bump the firmware version (major.minor) to 1.1. This version is
   backwards-compatible and doesn't require host-side (libsigrok) changes.

0.1.1 (2013-04-16)
------------------

 * Add support for the USBee DX. Only digital sampling is supported (as is
   the case for all other supported devices so far). Analog data acquisition
   is currently not implemented.
 * Add support for devices with the older Cypress CY7C68013 (FX2) chip
   instead of the more recent Cypress CY7C68013A (FX2LP). See also:
   http://sigrok.org/wiki/Fx2lafw#Cypress_FX2_vs._FX2LP
 * Convert to a standard autotools based build/configuration system.
   Installation is now: ./configure && make && make install
 * README: Update status, website URLs, requirements, etc.
 * Add the usual HACKING, AUTHORS, and INSTALL files.
 * Add a 'distbin' Make target, which creates a convenience tarball
   containing just the generated *.fw files.
 * Document the download location for the pre-built firmware files tarball.
 * If 'objcopy' is not found, try to use sdcc's 'makebin' instead.
   This fixes the build e.g. on some Mac OS X systems without 'objcopy'.
 * Add support for differently named sdcc tools on various distros.

0.1.0 (2012-07-24)
------------------

 * Initial release.
